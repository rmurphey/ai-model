# Model Assumptions and Limitations

## Model Assumptions

1. **Fully-loaded costs** include salary, benefits, and overhead
2. **Feature value** approximated by cost to develop
3. **Learning curves** follow exponential improvement
4. **Token prices** decline predictably over time
5. **Network effects** accelerate adoption at critical mass

### Cost Assumptions

- **Fully-Loaded Cost (FLC)**: Base salary Ã— 1.3-1.5 multiplier
- **Infrastructure costs** scale linearly with team size
- **Training effectiveness** is consistent across team members
- **Token usage** grows then plateaus predictably

### Adoption Assumptions

- **Technology adoption** follows Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations curve
- **Learning rates** are consistent within seniority levels
- **Dropout rates** remain constant over time
- **Re-engagement** occurs at a steady rate

### Impact Assumptions

- **Productivity gains** are realized immediately upon proficiency
- **Quality improvements** are uniform across code types
- **Task effectiveness** doesn't vary by project complexity
- **Benefits compound** linearly, not exponentially

### Value Assumptions

- **Time saved** translates directly to additional output
- **Quality improvements** reduce costs proportionally
- **Strategic value** can be quantified financially
- **Opportunity costs** are accurately captured

## Limitations

### Does Not Model

- **Competitive dynamics** explicitly
- **Market changes** or disruptions
- **Technology obsolescence** risk
- **Organizational resistance** beyond adoption rates
- **Integration complexity** with existing tools

### Assumes Stable

- **Team size** (can be modified but doesn't model growth dynamically)
- **Business model** and revenue streams
- **Development methodology** (Agile, Waterfall, etc.)
- **Tech stack** complexity

### Quality Caveats

- **Quality improvements** are estimates, not guarantees
- **Defect reduction** depends on implementation quality
- **Incident reduction** assumes proper AI tool usage
- **Technical debt** impact is simplified

### Financial Simplifications

- **Strategic value** is hardest to quantify precisely
- **NPV calculations** use simplified discounting
- **ROI** doesn't account for all externalities
- **Opportunity costs** are approximations

## Known Constraints

### Data Limitations

- **Industry benchmarks** may not match specific organizations
- **Adoption rates** based on technology adoption research
- **Cost estimates** use industry averages
- **Productivity metrics** derived from published studies

### Model Boundaries

- **Timeframe**: Most accurate for 12-36 month horizons
- **Team size**: Best for teams of 10-200 developers
- **Geography**: Costs based on US market rates
- **Industry**: Optimized for software companies

### Calculation Constraints

- **Monte Carlo**: Limited by computational resources
- **Sensitivity analysis**: First-order effects only
- **Correlations**: Simple linear relationships
- **Distributions**: Limited to common types

## Recommended Adjustments

### For Conservative Estimates

- Reduce impact factors by 20-30%
- Increase hidden costs by 50%
- Extend learning curve timeline
- Increase dropout rates

### For Specific Industries

- **Finance**: Increase security/compliance costs
- **Healthcare**: Extend adoption timeline
- **Startups**: Reduce infrastructure costs
- **Enterprise**: Increase training requirements

### For Different Geographies

- **Europe**: Adjust FLC costs (+/- 20%)
- **Asia**: Modify adoption rates
- **Remote**: Reduce infrastructure costs
- **Multi-site**: Increase coordination costs

## Validation Recommendations

1. **Pilot Programs**: Run small pilots to validate assumptions
2. **Baseline Measurement**: Accurately measure current metrics
3. **Progressive Rollout**: Phase adoption to test impact
4. **Regular Calibration**: Adjust parameters based on actuals
5. **Sensitivity Testing**: Focus on high-impact parameters
