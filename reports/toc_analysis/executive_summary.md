# Theory of Constraints Analysis - Executive Summary

## Overview

This report presents Theory of Constraints analysis across multiple scenarios using Goldratt's Five Focusing Steps methodology.

## Key Findings

### Constraint Distribution

- **Testing**: 10 scenarios
  - startup_balanced
  - startup_junior_heavy
  - midsize_balanced
  - ... and 7 more

### Performance Summary

| Scenario | Team Size | Constraint | Throughput | Exploitation | AI Adoption | Monthly Profit | ROI |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|-----|

| midsize_automated | 50 | testing | 2.2 | +46.2% | 10% | $1,143,529 | 152471% |
| enterprise_modern | 200 | testing | 2.2 | +46.2% | 10% | $1,139,279 | 22786% |
| midsize_senior_heavy | 50 | testing | 2.1 | +46.2% | 10% | $1,099,742 | 109974% |
| enterprise_traditional | 200 | testing | 2.0 | +46.2% | 10% | $1,056,397 | 26410% |
| midsize_balanced | 50 | testing | 1.9 | +46.2% | 10% | $1,022,154 | 136287% |

| startup_balanced | 10 | testing | 1.8 | +46.2% | 10% | $955,248 | 955248% |
| large_junior_army | 100 | testing | 1.8 | +46.2% | 10% | $954,548 | 119319% |
| startup_junior_heavy | 10 | testing | 1.8 | +46.2% | 10% | $924,709 | 924709% |

### Key Insights

1. **Exploitation Before Elevation**: All scenarios show 40-50% throughput improvement possible at $0 cost
2. **Testing Dominance**: Testing is the primary constraint in most scenarios
3. **AI Adoption**: Optimal AI adoption is constraint-focused, typically 10-30%, not maximum
4. **Flow Efficiency**: Most scenarios show flow efficiency < 70%, indicating queue waste

### Recommendations

1. **Apply Five Focusing Steps**:
   - Identify the constraint
   - Exploit it (zero-cost improvements)
   - Subordinate everything to it
   - Elevate only if necessary
   - Repeat the process

2. **Focus on Constraints**: Don't optimize non-constraints - it creates inventory, not throughput

3. **Make Queues Visible**: Hidden queue costs often exceed visible costs

4. **Implement WIP Limits**: Prevent queue buildup with work-in-progress constraints
